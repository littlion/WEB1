        <h1>Java Script 란 무엇인가?</h1>

        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use Javascript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm language. It conforms to the ECMAScript specification,[14] and has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
